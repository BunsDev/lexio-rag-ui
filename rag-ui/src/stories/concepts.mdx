# Concepts: Core Principles and building blocks

## Basic Components

### RAGProvider
The `RAGProvider` is the core component that provides the context for the [Lexio UI components](#ui-components)
 - It is responsible for managing the shared state for the UI components.
 - It is initialized with the retrieval and generating functions.


### Lexio UI components
- **ChatWindow**: Interactive chat interface.
- **AdvancedQueryField**: Enhancing user input with advanced query capabilities.
- **ErrorDisplay**: Handling and displaying errors gracefully.
- **SourcesDisplay**: Displaying an overview of the retrieved sources.
- **ContentDisplay**: Displaying the documents where the sources were taken from (with highlights if available)

### Retrieval and Generation functions
At least one of these functions must be provided to the `RAGProvider`
- **retrieveAndGenerate**: Gets the query and chat history => should return a response and sources of your RAG implementation. 
- **retrieve**: Retrieving content: Gets the query and chat history =>  should return only sources.
- **generate**: Generating content: Gets query, chat history and source of the last retrival => should return only a response.
- **getDataSource**: Retrieving data from a data source. E.g. a PDF, HTML, or other file format.


## Advanced Concepts

### Source Management
- **Source Types**: Different source types are available:
    -  Simple plain text as source - with the content nested 
    -  References to source documents: A reference to a document (pdf, mdx, html), that can include metadata and highlights that will be shown it deticated Viewers


### Response Handling
- **Streaming Responses**: There are stream interface available to implement streaming responses.
- **Follow-up Questions**: The generate function of the RAGProvider can be used to handle follow-up questions.

### Customization and Theming
- **Global Theme**: All components can be styled with a global theme that can be set in the `RAGProvider`.
    - You can either define a custom theme that implements the `Theme` interface or override the default theme (partially) with the `createTheme` function.
- **Component Styling**: Components can be styled individually with the `styleOverrides` prop.
    - Each components has a set of styles that can be overridden. See the component documentation for more information.
